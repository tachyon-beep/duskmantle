# Audit Summary

## Executive Summary
Duskmantle’s knowledge gateway is a well-structured FastAPI service with mature ingestion, search, and MCP integrations. Observability is strong (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, structured logs) and the test suite covers most critical flows (API security, search heuristics, scheduler, MCP smoke). The major gaps cluster around access control for the embedded UI, production hardening of rate limiting and readiness checks, and technical debt in the monolithic graph service. Addressing the top handful of findings will materially improve security posture and operational resilience without large rewrites.

Overall health score: **7/10** – solid foundation with clear, tractable hardening work.

## Key Metrics
- Lines of Python code: **20,189** (application + tests)
- Python modules documented: **87** (see `audit/MODULE_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- Automated tests: **44** Python test modules (+ Playwright UI harness)
- Coverage: **Not measured during audit** (recommend running `pytest --cov` in CI and publishing trend)
- External dependencies: Neo4j 5.x, Qdrant 1.7+, sentence-transformers 2.2+, FastAPI 0.110+

## Findings by Category
- **Security**: Unauthenticated UI lifecycle/event endpoints expose operational intelligence when auth is enabled (WP-001). Otherwise REST surface enforces scopes correctly.
- **Operational**: Rate limiter is per-process memory, and startup treats offline Neo4j/Qdrant as warnings. Backups fail lazily when script missing (WP-002, WP-003, WP-007).
- **Performance**: Maintainer Cypher endpoint lacks LIMIT guard; search graph enrichment is sequential, increasing latency under load (WP-004, WP-005).
- **Code Quality**: `gateway/graph/service.py` is ~1k lines combining concerns; difficult to evolve safely (WP-006).
- **Best Practice**: Retention knobs exist but undocumented; ML fallback lacks telemetry (WP-008, WP-009).

## Top 10 Priorities
1. WP-001 – Enforce UI auth on lifecycle/event endpoints
2. WP-003 – Fail fast on critical dependency outages
3. WP-002 – Externalise rate limiter storage
4. WP-004 – Cap maintainer Cypher query resource usage
5. WP-005 – Parallelise graph enrichment for search results
6. WP-007 – Validate backup script availability at startup
7. WP-008 – Surface search ML mode telemetry
8. WP-006 – Decompose `gateway/graph/service.py`
9. WP-009 – Document coverage & lifecycle history retention controls
10. WP-010 – Add auth-aware UI integration tests

## Recommended Immediate Actions
1. **Secure the embedded UI** (WP-001) – apply FastAPI auth dependencies to lifecycle/event routes, ship regression tests, and update docs before next release.
2. **Harden deployment readiness** (WP-003) – enable fail-fast startup mode in production and wire readiness probes to dependency status to avoid brown-outs during rollouts.
3. **Plan rate limiter backend migration** (WP-002) – provision Redis (or similar) and introduce configuration switch so throttles hold in multi-node environments.
4. **Add Cypher LIMIT clamp** (WP-004) – small change preventing heavy analyst queries from starving Neo4j.
5. **Announce telemetry gaps** (WP-008) – ensure operators can see when ML ranking is off.

Deliverables produced:
- `audit/MODULE_DOCUMENTATION.md` – per-module reference (classes, functions, dependencies, metrics) for all Python files.
- `audit/SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` – system architecture, technology stack, flows, and ops guidance.
- `audit/WORK_PACKAGES.md`, `audit/RISK_REGISTER.md`, `audit/QUICK_WINS.md` – actionable remediation plan with prioritised backlog.
