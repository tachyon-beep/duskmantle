# Audit Summary

## Executive Summary
The Duskmantle knowledge gateway delivers a cohesive hybrid search and graph experience that spans FastAPI, FastMCP, Neo4j, and Qdrant. The codebase is well-structured with clear service boundaries and strong test coverage across critical workflows. Recent hardening work now auto-generates credentials at startup, but several operational safeguards still lag behind production expectations: Qdrant collections can be recreated destructively, long-lived dependency handles are brittle, and backups rely on manual intervention. Addressing these gaps promptly will reduce the most acute security and availability risks while preserving the solid foundations already in place.

## Key Metrics
- Python modules analysed: 106
- Total Python LOC: 16965
- Production LOC: 10483
- Test LOC: 6482
- Work packages logged: 10 (Critical=2, High=4, Medium=4)
- Estimated technical debt ratio: ~0.35
- Current automated test coverage: Not measured in repository (run `pytest --cov=gateway --cov-report=term-missing`)

## Findings by Category
- **Security:** Secure boot now generates strong credentials automatically, but the maintainer Cypher endpoint (WP-003) remains permissive and needs read-only enforcement.
- **Operational:** Qdrant recreation (WP-002), missing dependency health checks (WP-004), and absent automated backups (WP-005) threaten uptime and recovery.
- **Performance:** Search graph enrichment runs serially and lacks protective fallbacks when Neo4j slows (WP-007).
- **Code Quality:** Incremental ingest ledger writes are fragile and merit schema validation plus atomic writes (WP-009); otherwise tests and structure are solid.
- **Best Practice:** Container images run as root and bundle all services (WP-006); API contracts remain unversioned (WP-010).
- **Enhancement:** Quick wins around feedback log rotation (WP-008) and backup automation (WP-005) unlock immediate resiliency gains.
- **Technical Debt:** Manual operational playbooks (backups, dependency recovery) and unbounded logs represent the bulk of outstanding debt but are addressable within upcoming sprints.

## Top 10 Priority Actions
1. **WP-004** – Add dependency health probes and auto-reconnect logic for Neo4j/Qdrant.
2. **WP-005** – Automate backups and document restoration procedures.
3. **WP-006** – Harden containers by running non-root and splitting data services.
4. **WP-007** – Optimise graph enrichment latency and guard against slow Neo4j responses.
5. **WP-008** – Rotate and monitor search feedback storage.
6. **WP-009** – Make incremental ingest ledger updates atomic and validated.
7. **WP-010** – Introduce explicit API versioning and compatibility guarantees.
8. **WP-001** – (Completed) Monitor the new secure-boot path and document procedures for custom deployments.
9. **WP-002** – (Completed) Keep regression tests guarding against destructive Qdrant resets.
10. **WP-003** – (Completed) Keep read-only Cypher safeguards documented and monitored.

## System Health Score
- **Overall score:** 6.5/10 (Amber) – Core functionality is reliable, but security posture and operational resilience require targeted remediation before production scale-out.

## Recommended Immediate Actions
- Schedule WP-004 and WP-005 immediately after to stabilise runtime behaviour and backups.
- Tackle Quick Wins (WP-008, WP-009, WP-010) alongside remediation for rapid, low-effort resilience gains.
