# Audit Summary

## Executive Summary
The Duskmantle gateway remains a well-structured platform with clear service boundaries, strong test coverage, and solid observability hooks. Search, graph, and ingest workflows share a consistent dependency layer, and every FastAPI route is guarded by rate limiting and scope checks. Recent hardening of backup retention removes the highest operational risk; the search stack is now decomposed into single-responsibility collaborators (`VectorRetriever`, `GraphEnricher`, `HeuristicScorer`, `ModelScorer`), eliminating the previous monolithic hot spot and making future relevance work far safer. Remaining gaps focus on configuration defaults, long-running telemetry storage, and promoting feedback into the ML training loop.

## Key Metrics
- Python modules analysed: 111 (production 71, tests 39, scripts 1)
- Total Python LOC: 18,751 (production 11,627; tests 7,041)
- Test focus: extensive pytest suite covering API, ingest, graph, MCP, and scheduler paths (`pytest.ini`)
- Observability: Prometheus metrics, structured logging, SlowAPI limits, optional OTLP tracing
- Deployment: Docker Compose with `gateway`, `neo4j:5.26.0`, and `qdrant/qdrant:1.15.4`; backups managed via `bin/km-backup`

## Findings By Category
- **Security** – Auth boots are now secure by default (`gateway/config/settings.py:50`), but direct CREATE_APP users still need to supply non-default credentials when disabling auth; continue monitoring for credential hygiene gaps. (WP-201 completed)
- **Operational** – `/api/v1/audit/history` clamps requests to `KM_AUDIT_HISTORY_MAX_LIMIT`; operators can monitor clamp warnings via `Warning` headers. (WP-208 completed)
- **Performance** – Graph enrichment now honours configurable result/time budgets; continue monitoring metrics (`km_search_graph_skipped_total`) to ensure operators tune limits appropriately. (WP-204 completed)
- **Code Quality** – `SearchService` now composes dedicated collaborators, shrinking the class and improving testability. Monitor follow-up to keep collaborator interfaces documented and consistent. (WP-206 completed)
- **Best Practice** – REST routes lack versioning, so protocol changes break MCP clients with no migration path (`gateway/api/routes/*.py`). (WP-207)
- **Enhancement** – Collected feedback never feeds the ML scoring pipeline; no tooling exports datasets for `gateway/search/trainer.py`. (WP-209)
- **Technical Debt** – Artifact ledger writes are now atomic and locked; continue monitoring for lock timeouts during heavy ingest. (WP-205 completed)

## Top Priority Actions
1. **WP-209** – Export feedback logs into the training pipeline to revive ML scoring.
2. Expand integration coverage for search graph skip metrics to validate the new enrichment budgets under load.
3. Document operator runbooks for tuning new graph/time budgets and ML feature expectations.

## Overall System Health
- **Score**: 7/10 (Amber) – Core functionality is dependable and well tested, but tightening auth defaults, backup safety, and graph/search performance is necessary before scaling to less supervised environments.

## Recommended Immediate Actions
- Focus next on WP-209 (feedback export) and schedule integration coverage for the new search graph budgets while updating operator runbooks for the new collaborators.
