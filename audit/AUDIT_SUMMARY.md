# Audit Summary

## Executive Summary
The Duskmantle gateway remains a well-structured platform with clear service boundaries, strong test coverage, and solid observability hooks. Search, graph, and ingest workflows share a consistent dependency layer, and every FastAPI route is guarded by rate limiting and scope checks. Recent hardening of backup retention removes the highest operational risk; remaining gaps focus on configuration defaults, long-running telemetry storage, and the monolithic search service. Addressing the highlighted work packages will harden day-to-day operations without disrupting the existing architecture, while a modest refactor of the monolithic search service will unlock faster iteration on relevance improvements.

## Key Metrics
- Python modules analysed: 111 (production 71, tests 39, scripts 1)
- Total Python LOC: 18,751 (production 11,627; tests 7,041)
- Test focus: extensive pytest suite covering API, ingest, graph, MCP, and scheduler paths (`pytest.ini`)
- Observability: Prometheus metrics, structured logging, SlowAPI limits, optional OTLP tracing
- Deployment: Docker Compose with `gateway`, `neo4j:5.26.0`, and `qdrant/qdrant:1.15.4`; backups managed via `bin/km-backup`

## Findings By Category
- **Security** – Auth boots are now secure by default (`gateway/config/settings.py:50`), but direct CREATE_APP users still need to supply non-default credentials when disabling auth; continue monitoring for credential hygiene gaps. (WP-201 completed)
- **Operational** – `/api/v1/audit/history` clamps requests to `KM_AUDIT_HISTORY_MAX_LIMIT`; operators can monitor clamp warnings via `Warning` headers. (WP-208 completed)
- **Performance** – Graph enrichment now honours configurable result/time budgets; continue monitoring metrics (`km_search_graph_skipped_total`) to ensure operators tune limits appropriately. (WP-204 completed)
- **Code Quality** – `SearchService` has grown past 1k LOC combining vector search, graph enrichment, and ML ranking, complicating reviews and targeted testing. (WP-206)
- **Best Practice** – REST routes lack versioning, so protocol changes break MCP clients with no migration path (`gateway/api/routes/*.py`). (WP-207)
- **Enhancement** – Collected feedback never feeds the ML scoring pipeline; no tooling exports datasets for `gateway/search/trainer.py`. (WP-209)
- **Technical Debt** – Artifact ledger writes are now atomic and locked; continue monitoring for lock timeouts during heavy ingest. (WP-205 completed)

## Top Priority Actions
1. **WP-206** – Decompose `SearchService` for maintainability and clearer extensibility.
2. **WP-209** – Export feedback logs into the training pipeline to revive ML scoring.
3. Expand integration coverage for search graph skip metrics to validate the new enrichment budgets under load.

## Overall System Health
- **Score**: 7/10 (Amber) – Core functionality is dependable and well tested, but tightening auth defaults, backup safety, and graph/search performance is necessary before scaling to less supervised environments.

## Recommended Immediate Actions
- Focus next on WP-206 (search service refactor) while planning WP-209 (feedback export) and scheduling integration coverage for the new search graph budgets.
