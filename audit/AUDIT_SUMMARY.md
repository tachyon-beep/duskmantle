# Audit Summary

## Executive Summary
Duskmantle’s knowledge gateway is a well-structured FastAPI service with mature ingestion, search, and MCP integrations. Observability is strong (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, structured logs) and the test suite covers most critical flows (API security, search heuristics, scheduler, MCP smoke). The major gaps cluster around access control for the embedded UI, production hardening of rate limiting and readiness checks, and technical debt in the monolithic graph service. Addressing the top handful of findings will materially improve security posture and operational resilience without large rewrites.

Overall health score: **7/10** – solid foundation with clear, tractable hardening work.

## Key Metrics
- Lines of Python code: **20,189** (application + tests)
- Python modules documented: **87** (see `audit/MODULE_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- Automated tests: **44** Python test modules (+ Playwright UI harness)
- Coverage: **Not measured during audit** (recommend running `pytest --cov` in CI and publishing trend)
- External dependencies: Neo4j 5.x, Qdrant 1.7+, sentence-transformers 2.2+, FastAPI 0.110+

## Findings by Category
- **Security**: Unauthenticated UI lifecycle/event endpoints expose operational intelligence when auth is enabled (WP-001). Otherwise REST surface enforces scopes correctly.
- **Operational**: Rate limiter is per-process memory, and startup treats offline Neo4j/Qdrant as warnings. Backups fail lazily when script missing (WP-002, WP-003, WP-007).
- **Performance**: Maintainer Cypher endpoint lacks LIMIT guard; search graph enrichment is sequential, increasing latency under load (WP-004, WP-005).
- **Code Quality**: `gateway/graph/service.py` is ~1k lines combining concerns; difficult to evolve safely (WP-006).
- **Best Practice**: Retention knobs exist but undocumented; ML fallback lacks telemetry (WP-008, WP-009).

## Top Priorities
1. WP-002 – Externalise rate limiter storage
2. WP-004 – Cap maintainer Cypher query resource usage
3. WP-005 – Parallelise graph enrichment for search results
4. WP-007 – Validate backup script availability at startup
5. WP-008 – Surface search ML mode telemetry
6. WP-006 – Decompose `gateway/graph/service.py`
7. WP-009 – Document coverage & lifecycle history retention controls
8. WP-010 – Add auth-aware UI integration tests

## Recommended Immediate Actions
1. **Plan rate limiter backend migration** (WP-002) – provision Redis (or similar) and introduce configuration switch so throttles hold in multi-node environments.
2. **Add Cypher LIMIT guard** (WP-004) – prevent maintainer queries from consuming unbounded resources.
3. **Parallelise graph enrichment** (WP-005) – reduce search latency by batching Neo4j lookups.
4. **Validate backup tooling upfront** (WP-007) – surface missing scripts/destinations during startup.
5. **Expose ML scoring telemetry** (WP-008) – add metrics and metadata to highlight heuristic fallbacks.

Deliverables produced:
