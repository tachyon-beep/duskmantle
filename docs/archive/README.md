# Archived Documentation

This directory stores historical planning artefacts that are no longer maintained as living documents but remain available for reference.

- `WORK_PACKAGES.md` — original work-package overview captured during early planning.
- `WP5/` — execution plans and observability notes for Work Package 5.
- `WP6/` — release tooling roadmap and milestone notes for Work Package 6.

Active specifications and runbooks continue to live in the top-level `docs/` directory. Update references to archived files using their new paths (e.g., `docs/archive/WP6/WP6_RELEASE_TOOLING_PLAN.md`).
